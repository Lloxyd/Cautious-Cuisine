# Cautious-Cuisine.
Project for Hackathon.
The website is developed primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The structure consists of 24 distinct HTML files, each paired with a corresponding CSS file, and a single JavaScript file that ties everything together. The central HTML file, "allergy.html," serves as the main hub for the website. This file references all other individual HTML files through JavaScript, which dynamically navigates users based on their selected dietary preferences.

The HTML files were meticulously crafted to display restaurant options filtered by various dietary requirements, including both single and combined filters. When the "Go" button is clicked, the website responds by presenting the relevant restaurant options according to the selected filters.

All CSS files share a consistent background, contributing to the website's formal and cohesive appearance. The JavaScript file was carefully designed to process user inputs, filter the corresponding HTML file names, and redirect users to the appropriate webpage based on their dietary choices.

By integrating these three programming languages, "Cautious Cuisine" effectively delivers a seamless and user-friendly experience, allowing users to easily find restaurants that cater to their specific dietary needs.
